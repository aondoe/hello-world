Basic use of git
Well I am a late adopter to many technologies especially the web, because it's hard to know what's useful and what's just another soon to be forgotten trend/fad/framework. But I must say I understand the utility of this technology.

O and side note I have to use it on the job I just got hired in. I start in 3 days.
